TAXI SERVICE
Nowadays services like Ola and Uber have become very popular. One feature that makes them particularly attractive is that their apps inform you of the time it will take for the nearest taxi to reach your current location. In this project we will investigate the software structure required to support this kind of service, with a special emphasis, of course, on the data structures aspect. In this, the task is to route the customer request to the nearest available taxi.
